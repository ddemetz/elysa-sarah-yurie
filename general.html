		<p class="general-facts"> Here are some statistics we at Her World have found on women in the workplace:
			<br> ~64% of women face microaggresions. These affronts include being mistaken for a much more junior employee and having their judgement questioned in their area of expertise. 
       <br> ~1/5 of women reported that they’re frequently the only woman (or one of the only women) in the groups of people they work with at the office. It’s more like 40% for women in senior leadership and those in technical roles. Just 7% of men are in the reverse situation.
       <br> ~Nearly a quarter of women, but only 8% of men, believe that “their gender has played a role in missing out on a raise, promotion, or chance to get ahead.” And 29% of women, compared to only 15% of men, believe their gender will be an obstacle to advancement in the future. Women are also less likely than men to believe that their workplaces are fair, with black women being the least likely to agree that “the best opportunities go to the most deserving employees” or that promotions are “based on fair and objective criteria.”
