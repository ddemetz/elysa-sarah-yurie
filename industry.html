      <h1> Entertainment Stats:</h1>
      <p>From musicians, movie stars, and media influencers, the odds are stacked against female and minority stars from both the outside perspective and in their workplace compared to their male counterparts. Within the media and entertainment industry, studies have shown that progressing and being promoted becomes slower and slower for women as they begin to reach the corporate level of the media. This further proves as to why it was found that women leave their entry-level jobs at higher rates than men. In a study called “It’s a Man’s (Celluloid) World: Portrayals of Female Characters in the Top Grossing Films of 2019 by Dr. Martha M. Lauzen,” the research shows how males portrayed 63% of the major character roles, while females only made up about ⅓ of them. Meanwhile in the music industry, the year prior had seen women make up only 17% of the top artists on the Billboard Hot 100 year-end charts. Most commonly seen as male dominated market and workplace, the video game industry in which produces content and entertainment for an audience that is 40% female, tend to keep their representation of women stereotypical, passive, oversexualized and low. At the popular video game conference in 2019 called E3, women in the industry came to about only 20% of the conference speakers. These statistics show the need for more female representation within the industry, in order to successfully and positively display the female models their players need. Within all these aspects of representation and discrimination against women in entertainment, it further shows the need for equality in order to create safe spaces in the workplace and inspire the next generation of girls pursuing a career in this industry.

      <h1>Minorities:</h1>
      <p>One of the industries most infamous for being non-inclusive is the modeling industry. The Fashion Spot reported that “27.9 percent of the models who walked the fall 2017 runways were nonwhite.” Without a strong diversity of models, the standards of beauty are raised and set as “primarily white” for women. Dr.Lauzen’s study shows an increasing gap between the roles of white female characters (68%) and other races like Black (20%), Latina or Asian (both less than 10%). However, in the music field, a study by Professor Stacy L. Smith found that “of the female performers in 2018, 73% were women of color. This seven-year high point reveals that the music industry is including women of color in ways that other forms of entertainment are not." The higher amount of representation of music helps to promote different cultures, which can inspire the next generation of female musicians of color.
